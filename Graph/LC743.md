### Solution
```
class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for s,e,t in times:
            graph[s].append((e, t))
            
        # build heap
        heap = [(0, k)]
        heapq.heapify
        res = dict()
        
        while heap:
            total, cur = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if cur not in res:
                res[cur] = total
                
                for node, time in graph[cur]:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (total+time, node))

        delay = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if i not in res:
                return -1
            delay = max(delay, res[i])
        return delay
