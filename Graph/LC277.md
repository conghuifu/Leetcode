### Solution
```
# The knows API is already defined for you.
# return a bool, whether a knows b
# def knows(a: int, b: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def findCelebrity(self, n: int) -> int:
        C = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if knows(C, i):
                C = i
        
        for i in range(C):
            if knows(C, i):
                return -1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not knows(i, C): return -1
        
        return C
