### Solution
method 1 save all the available numbers in dictionary and re-index them, that will TLE (memory). The other method(2) is that we map all the blacklist number into the previous list. so thet dictionary just save the blacklist lookup dictionary <br />
1. TLE
```
class Solution:

    def __init__(self, n: int, blacklist: List[int]):
        self.ct = 0
        self.search = dict()
        blacklist = set(blacklist)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in blacklist:
                self.search[self.ct] = i
                self.ct += 1
    def pick(self) -> int:
        index = random.choice(range(self.ct))
        return self.search[index]


# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(n, blacklist)
# param_1 = obj.pick()
```

        for i in range(self.l, n):
            if i not in b:

                j += 1
