#### Solution Two Poiters
1. Brute Force search <br />
Complexity: O(n^3). Space: O(n) <br />
2. optimization on Brute Force, and record the current max and min, if the range > limit, update the left index. and research the min/max value in from left to curreng index.  <br />
Complexity: O(n^2). Space: O(1) <br />
3. the optimization on method 2 is that we need to research the max and min value. we can save the decreasing list and increasing list (if nums, decreasing&increasing, if index, equals allow. cuz index always different). So we maintain two deques. And we use the left elements of two deques to calculate the difference. When it is larger than the limit, move the left index. Until find the satisfied range. <br />
Complexity: O(n). Space:O(n)
