#### Solution Pointer + Recursion
Complexity: O(26N) (one looping is N, the worst case is doing recursion for 26 times (we only have at most 26 charaters))
```
class Solution:
    def longestSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        if len(s) < k: return 0

        keys =  list(hashset)

                hashset.pop(key) # we can either pop the keys satisfy/unsatisfy the requiremnt, but the second way will exceed the memory. Wait!!! at here we need to pop the satisfy requiremnts, so that the most recursion times are only 26!!!
