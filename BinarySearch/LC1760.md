##### Wrong answers I made
1. split from the largest num
local optimization, not global optimization
2. priority queue
split the largest bag using the second big number
e.g. ex1: arr = [7, 5, 3], ops = 3
7 -> [5, 2]  work
but it fails when arr = [10^9, 1], both space and time exceeds
also it fails when arr = [6, 6, 6], no guidence

##### True answewr
guess the maximum balls in each bag
to check the number of operations to achieving this result. 
if ops > maxOps: increase the balls
because the balls number is mononically, we can use the BS

```
class Solution:
    def minimumSize(self, nums: List[int], maxOperations: int) -> int:
        left = 1
        right = max(nums) + 1
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            ops = 0
            for balls in nums:
                # balls <= mid: 0
                # balls > mid
                # 1. balls % mid == 0: balls/mid - 1
                # 2. balls % mid > 0: [balls/mid] - 1
                # (balls - 1) // mid + 1 - 1 = (balls - 1) // mid
                ops += (balls - 1) // mid
            if ops > maxOperations:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        return left
```

### recap
```
class Solution:
    def minimumSize(self, nums: List[int], maxOperations: int) -> int:
        l, r = 1, max(nums)
        while l + 1 < r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if self.count(nums, mid) <= maxOperations:
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid
        if self.count(nums, l) <= maxOperations:
            return l
        return r
    
    def count(self, nums, div):
        res = 0
        for num in nums:
            ### be careful here. no ops for small num. for larger num, take 1 ops to split into 2
            if num > div:
                res += (num - 1)//div
        return res
        
# (a-1)//b. +1
```
