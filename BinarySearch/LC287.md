#### Solution 1 Build dictionary
build a dictionary, and when the number does not exist in dict, add it in. else return the current number /n
Complexity: O(n) /n
Space: O(n)

#### Solution 2 Binary search
it is kind of hard to think the BS. But because the number range is fixed, and the answer must exists within the range. We can try it. /n
BS answer:
key point: if the number appears only once, the number of elements smaller or equal than current number should smaller or equal to current number, else this number is duplicated. /n
when to use BS to search answer:/n
1. answer falls into the limited range /n
2. easy to know if answer satisfy (or not), what the result will be /n
Complexity: O(nlogn) /n
Space: O(1)

class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 1
        right = max(nums) + 1
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            small_ct = 0
            for i in nums:
                if i <= mid: small_ct += 1
            if small_ct > mid:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
