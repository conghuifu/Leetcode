#### Solution 1 Build dictionary
build a dictionary, and when the number does not exist in dict, add it in. else return the current number <br />
Complexity: O(n) <br />
Space: O(n)

#### Solution 2 Binary search
it is kind of hard to think the BS. But because the number range is fixed, and the answer must exists within the range. We can try it. <br />
BS answer:
key point: if the number appears only once, the number of elements smaller or equal than current number should smaller or equal to current number, else this number is duplicated. <br />
when to use BS to search answer:<br />
1. answer falls into the limited range <br />
2. easy to know if answer satisfy (or not), what the result will be <br />
Complexity: O(nlogn) <br />
Space: O(1)

class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 1
        right = max(nums) + 1
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            small_ct = 0
            for i in nums:
                if i <= mid: small_ct += 1
            if small_ct > mid:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

#### recap
1. BS 
```
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = min(nums), max(nums)
        while l + 1 < r:
            mid = l + (r - l)//2
            if self.count(nums, mid) <= mid:
                l = mid
            else:
                r = mid
        if self.count(nums, l) > l:
            return l
        return r
        
    def count(self, nums, target):
        ct = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num <= target:
                ct += 1
        return ct
```
2. set
```
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        seen = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num not in seen:
                seen.add(num)
            else:
                return num
```
