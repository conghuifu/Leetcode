#### Solution 
different from asteroids, every letter disappears after collision, so using if instead of while. Only when no equals, the element can be added into the stack.
```
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = collections.deque()
        for i in s:
            if stack and (stack[-1] == i):
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(i)
        return ''.join(stack)
```
