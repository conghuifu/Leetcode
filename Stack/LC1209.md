### Solution
1. stack. the new duplicates may generate after removing the duplicates, using stack. When it refers to continuous count (remind the question to search the continuous days smaller than the current day), stack should be the list of lists (element, count) <br />
complexity: O(n). Space: O(n)
```
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        stack = collections.deque()
        
        for i in s:
        	# if dont wanna judge if stack, change line 6 as stack = [['#', 0]]
            if stack and (i == stack[-1][0]):
                stack[-1][1] += 1
                if stack[-1][1] == k:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append([i, 1])
                        
        return ''.join([s*ct for s, ct in stack])
```
