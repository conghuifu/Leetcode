#### Solution
1. brute force <br />
calculate how many nearby bars higher or equal to the current bar, the trick is to save the left higher and right higher bars. <br />
complexity: O(n^2). Space: O(n)
```
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(heights)
        left = [1 for i in range(n)]
        right = [1 for i in range(n)]
        
        # calculate left bar higher than current bar
        for i in range(1, n):
            j = i - 1
            while (j >= 0) and (heights[j] >= heights[i]):
                j -= left[j]
            left[i] = i - j
        # calculate right bar higher than current bar 
        for i in range(n-1)[::-1]:
            j = i + 1
            while (j < n) and (heights[j] >= heights[i]):
                j += right[j]
            right[i] = j - i
            
        maxSize = 0
        for i in range(n):
            maxSize = max(maxSize, heights[i] * (left[i] + right[i] - 1))
        return maxSize  
```
2. actually it equals to find the next smaller index for each bar on its left side and right side. then right side (ls) - left side(rs) - 1 equals to length. if we can find the smaller, for the right side, fill it as length of heights, for the left side, fill it as -1. <br />
Complexity: O(5n), space:(3n)
```
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        ls = dict()
        rs = dict()
        stack = collections.deque()
        maxSize = 0
        n = len(heights)
        
        for i in range(n):
            while stack and (heights[stack[-1]] > heights[i]):
                ls[stack.pop()] = i
            stack.append(i)
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in ls:
                ls[i] = n

        for i in range(n)[::-1]:
            while stack and (heights[stack[-1]] > heights[i]):
                rs[stack.pop()] = i
            stack.append(i)
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in rs:
                rs[i] = -1
        
        for i in range(n):
            maxSize = max(maxSize, heights[i] * (ls[i] - rs[i] - 1))
        return maxSize
```
2.1
based on 2, we initiate ls and rs in list instead of dictionary. <br />
Complexity: O(3n). Space: (3n)
```
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(heights)
        ls = [n for i in range(n)]
        rs = [-1 for i in range(n)]
        stack = collections.deque()
        maxSize = 0
        
        
        for i in range(n):
            while stack and (heights[stack[-1]] > heights[i]):
                ls[stack.pop()] = i
            stack.append(i)

        for i in range(n)[::-1]:
            while stack and (heights[stack[-1]] > heights[i]):
                rs[stack.pop()] = i
            stack.append(i)
        
        for i in range(n):
            maxSize = max(maxSize, heights[i] * (ls[i] - rs[i] - 1))
        return maxSize
```
3. based on 2, we know that after poping the last element in stack, if stack still has the values, the last value in remaining stack, must be the nearest smaller bar (cuz larger bar has been popped). So we dont need to go through the heights again to get the left side bar. just use the current index - stack[-1] - 1 (stack here after pop), is the width. <br />

class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = collections.deque()
        n = len(heights)
        maxSize = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] > heights[i]:
                lastH = heights[stack.pop()]
                if stack:
                    w = i - stack[-1] - 1
                else:
                    w = i
                maxSize = max(maxSize, lastH * w)
            stack.append(i)
        
        while stack:
            h = heights[stack.pop()]
            if stack:
                w = n - stack[-1] - 1
            else:
                w = n
            maxSize = max(maxSize, h*w)
            
        return maxSize
```
4. advanced. <br />
Complexity: O(2n). Space: (n)
```
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = collections.deque([-1])
        heights.append(0)
        maxRec = 0
        
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            while (heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]):
                lastH = heights[stack.pop()]
                w = i - stack[-1] - 1
                maxRec = max(maxRec, lastH * w)
            stack.append(i)
            
        return maxRec
```
