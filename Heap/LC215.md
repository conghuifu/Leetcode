### Solution
it's an online algorithm since each time the top of heap is the kth largest element, and it's scalable if the input is a stream. <br />
1. space: O(k), complexity: O(nlogk)
```
import heapq
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        heap = nums[:k]
        heapq.heapify(heap) # create a min heap 
        
        for num in nums[k:]:
            if num > heap[0]:
                heapq.heappushpop(heap, num)
                
        return heap[0]
```
2. 
```
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        heap = []
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        for num in nums:
            if (len(heap) < k) or (num > heap[0]):
                heapq.heappush(heap, num)
            if len(heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
                
        return heap[0]
```
