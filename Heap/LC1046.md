### Solution
1. maximum heap <br />
python only keeps the minimum heap, so get max heap, just * -1 for all elements. and be careful the situation when no elements
```
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        stones = [-1*i for i in stones]
        heapq.heapify(stones)
        
        while len(stones) >= 2:
            x, y = heapq.heappop(stones), heapq.heappop(stones)
            if x!= y:
                heapq.heappush(stones, -abs(x-y))
        if not stones: return 0
        return -stones[0]
```

### recap
```
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        heap = [-i for i in stones]
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        while len(heap) > 1:
            val1 = heapq.heappop(heap)
            val2 = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if -val1 > -val2:
                heapq.heappush(heap, val1 - val2)
        if len(heap) == 0:
            return 0
        return -heap[0]
