#### Solution
if we try greedy search, it will cost Cn1 + Cn2 + ... + Cnn = 2^n combinations. it will timeout. intrinctly, we are trying to devide the array into several intervals to satisfy the minimun height within the required width. <br />
so we assume the new row each time, and try to merge with the earlist book. So we need two loops, the first loop starting the new row, the second book searching for last interval merge. <br />
```
class Solution:
    def minHeightShelves(self, books: List[List[int]], shelf_width: int) -> int:
        # build the dp to save the total height until i
        # start from i, then looping from i to 0, each loop assuming start since the new row, and seeking for the merge with the earlist book row
        n = len(books)
        if n == 0: return 0
        
        # min
        dp = [sys.maxsize for i in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            w = 0
            h = 0
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                w += books[j][0]
                if w > shelf_width:
                    break
                h = max(h, books[j][1])
                if j == 0:
                    dp[i] = h
                else:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + h)
        return dp[-1]
```
